        <ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax,
                dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
                standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</li>
            <br>
            <li>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other
                software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.</li>
            <br>
            <li>97% of webpages uses JavaScript.</li>

            <br>
            <li>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                displayed in a web browser.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
                JavaScript.</li>
            <br>
            <li>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such
                as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.</li>

        <h2><u>Python</u></h2>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">

        </a>
        <p><i>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.</i></p>
        <ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear,
                logical code for small and large-scale projects.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage
                collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds
                method and variable names during program execution.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often
                uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after
                statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special
                cases than C or Pascal.</li>

        <p><i>Firebase helps you build and run successful apps</i></p>
        <ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It was originally an independent company founded in 2011. In 2014, Google acquired the platform and it
                is now their flagship offering for app development.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Firebase evolved from Envolve, a prior startup founded by James Tamplin and Andrew Lee in 2011. Envolve
                provided developers an API that enables the integration of online chat functionality into their
                websites.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Firebase's first product was the Firebase Realtime Database, an API that synchronizes application data
                across iOS, Android, and Web devices, and stores it on Firebase's cloud. The product assists software
                developers in building real-time, collaborative applications.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Firebase have these features:- Cloud Messaging, Authentication, Test Lab, Hosting, Remote Configuration,
                Dynamic Links, Crash Reporting, Real-time Database and Storage</li>

        <h2><u>React Native</u></h2>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_Native">
            <img src="images/reactNative.png" width="200px" height="200px">
        </a>
        <p><i>React Native is an open-source UI software framework created by Facebook, Inc.</i></p>
        <ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by
                enabling developers to use the React framework along with native platform capabilities.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It is also being used to develop virtual reality applications at Oculus.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The working principles of React Native are virtually identical to React except that React Native does
                not manipulate the DOM via the Virtual DOM. It runs in a background process (which interprets the
                JavaScript written by the developers) directly on the end-device and communicates with the native
                platform via serialized data over an asynchronous and batched bridge.</li>
            <br>
            <li>React Native also allows developers to write native code in languages such as Java or Kotlin for
                Android, Objective-C or Swift for iOS, and C++/WinRT or C# for Windows 10, which makes it even more
                flexible.</li>
